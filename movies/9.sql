-- write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie released in 2004, ordered by birth year.
-- Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.
-- People with the same birth year may be listed in any order.
-- No need to worry about people who have no birth year listed, so long as those who do have a birth year are listed in order.
-- If a person appeared in more than one movie in 2004, they should only appear in your results once.

select name from people where id in (select person_id from stars where movie_id in (select id  from movies where year = 2004)) order by birth;
